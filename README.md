# Market_Basket_Optimisation

The goal of this project is to use apriori to predict what products the customer is going to buy next by looking at what he is buying

## Description

A grocery store owner wants to optimize the boost sale by making an offer 'buy this and get that for free'. So he asked you to identify what products that will fit best for the offer.

## Output of the project

I use association rule learning (apriori) to find the best match products, in other words saying if customers buying this product there's a high chance of them buying that other product too. After applying the algorithm, we get some of the match products that would fit best
